Abstract: The production of energy has an impact on the environment and our own health. Different types of power plants emit varying amounts of air pollution into the atmosphere. Our group explored how data science could be used to identify relationships between power plant type and atmospheric conditions. Data from power plants around the world in conjunction with data about CO2 and particulate matter levels were collected. We chose PM 2.5 as our proxy for air pollution due to its impact on respiratory health. The atmospheric effects of different power plant types on particulate levels were estimated via OLS regression. We found that Coal, Gas, and Hydro power plants all increase average exposure to PM2.5. Specifically, this paper uses two separate models to approximate the effects of each power plant type. The first model estimates that a 1 percent increase in gas power plants causes a country's mean annual PM2.5 exposure to increase by 0.029 micrograms per cubic meter. It also suggests that a 1 percent increase in hydro power plants causes a country's mean annual PM2.5 exposure to increase by 0.0237 micrograms per cubic meter. The second model estimates that a 1 percent increase in coal power plants causes a countries mean annual PM2.5 exposure to increase by 1.3667 micrograms per cubic meter. Our results suggest that countries should curtail the development of Coal, Hydro and Gas power plants. The lack of statistical significance in power plant types such as Nuclear, Waste, Wind, and Solar leave room for more research questions.  <br />
